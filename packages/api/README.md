## Running the Development Server

To start the development server, run:

```bash
bun dev
```

Ensure your setup is correct by following the steps below.

---

## Environment Variables

1. **Fill Out `.dev.vars`**:

   - Ensure all required fields in the `.dev.vars` file are filled out completely.

2. **Initialization**:

   - If you need to use environment variables outside the Hono app, initialize the configuration using `dotenv` and specify the `.dev.vars` path:
     ```typescript
     import dotenv from "dotenv";
     dotenv.config({ path: ".dev.vars" });
     ```

3. **Accessing Environment Variables Within Hono**:
   - Set environment variables within the `c` (context) object using `c.set("NAME", value)` and pass `c` to your functions as needed.

---

## Auth Configuration

1. **Setup Client ID and Secret**:

   - Provide the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** for authentication in your `.dev.vars` file.

2. **Supported Clients**:

   - Currently tested with Google and GitHub clients.

3. **Adding Additional Clients**:
   - Update the `.dev.vars` file with the new clientâ€™s credentials.
   - Modify your authentication logic to support the new client.

---

## Adding New Environment Variables

1. **Updating `.dev.vars`**:

   - Add the new variable directly to the `.dev.vars` file.

2. **Using Variables Outside Hono**:

   - Ensure the configuration is initialized using `dotenv` as described above.

3. **Using Variables Within Hono**:
   - Set the variable within the `c` (context) object:
     ```typescript
     c.set("NEW_VAR_NAME", process.env.NEW_VAR_NAME);
     ```
   - Pass the context (`c`) to any functions requiring access to the variable.
